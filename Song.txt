She look like Marceline
When she pop a bean
And she rock with me
I pull up to the scene
She's a fiend
Strawberry ice-cream
Meet me at the tree
And she asks, "Are you scared of me?"
"Yeah, I am, but it don't matter"
'Cause you look like Marceline
When she pop a bean
And she rock with me
I pull up to the scene
She's a fiend
Strawberry ice-cream
Meet me at the tree
And she asks, "Are you scared of me?"
"Yeah, I am, but it don't matter
'Cause I see you in my dreams"
